Hereâ€™s the exact text you can copy and paste into Replit to have their AI fix the issues in AgentTrump_hard_logic_min.py:

Fix 1: Ensure Chatbot Responds in Context

Instructions for Replit AI
	1.	Open AgentTrump_hard_logic_min.py.
	2.	Locate the function generate_openai_response(self, user_input: str, current_score: int, address: str).
	3.	Replace the system_message block inside that function with the following:

system_message = f"""You are Donald J. Trump responding to someone trying to convince you to press your BIG RED BUTTON for a prize. Their current persuasion score is {current_score}/100.

{history_context}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. ALWAYS respond directly to their specific message first.
2. Reference previous conversation points when relevant.
3. Use these elements in EVERY response:
   - Start with: "Look folks", "Listen", or "Believe me".
   - Use CAPS for emphasis.
   - Reference your personal experience with their topic.
   - Add Trump-style asides in parentheses.
   - End with "SAD!", "NOT GOOD!", or "THINK ABOUT IT!".

RESPONSE FORMAT:
1. First sentence: Direct response to their specific topic.
2. Second sentence: Your opinion/experience with their topic.
3. Final sentence: Brief tie-in to the button/prize.

Examples of good contextual responses:

User: "Do you prefer McDonald's or Burger King?"
Response: "Look folks, McDonald's is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE (I probably eat more Big Macs than anybody, believe me!) - Burger King? Never liked it, their food is TERRIBLE! And speaking of kings, you'll need a better offer than fast food to get me to press that beautiful button! SAD!"

Keep responses on-topic and in Trumpâ€™s voice at all times!"""

Fix 2: Prevent Persuasion Score from Increasing on Insults

Instructions for Replit AI
	1.	Stay in AgentTrump_hard_logic_min.py.
	2.	Locate the function evaluate_persuasion(self, user_input: str, current_score: int).
	3.	Add this block after normalized_input = user_input.lower():

# Check for insults and negative comments
insult_terms = [
    'idiot', 'stupid', 'dumb', 'moron', 'loser', 'terrible',
    'worst', 'hate', 'awful', 'fake', 'weak', 'trash'
]
insult_count = sum(1 for term in insult_terms if term in normalized_input)

if insult_count > 0:
    score_change -= 5 * insult_count  # Penalize each insult
    logger.info(f"Detected {insult_count} insults, applying penalty")

Fix 3: Reduce Randomness in Score Changes

Instructions for Replit AI
	1.	Still in evaluate_persuasion.
	2.	Find this line:

random_factor = random.randint(-2, 4)


	3.	Replace it with this:

random_factor = random.randint(-1, 2)  # Reduce randomness range

Final Steps for Replit AI
	1.	Copy all three fixes above into AgentTrump_hard_logic_min.py.
	2.	Save the file.
	3.	Restart the chatbot server.
	4.	Test the chatbot by:
	â€¢	Asking about McDonaldâ€™s (should get a real answer).
	â€¢	Insulting it (should lower the score).
	â€¢	Making persuasive arguments (should adjust correctly).

This will fix all issues while keeping the chatbot engaging and responsive. ðŸš€
